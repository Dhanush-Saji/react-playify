You can reach me **dhanushsaji1@gmail.com**

## Features
* Lightweight
* Small size
* Accessible

## Install

```javascript
npm i react-media-playback
```

## Quick Start

Don't forget to pass the audio array and the `useState` variables along with their respective set functions.
Also, avoid setting the value to true initially. This is because the `audio` element can't be played until there is a DOM interaction by the user, as per the browser's rule, and we can't override this.
**If it seems confusing üò∞üò∞, don't worry, it's simple.**

#### ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚ùå Don't set the value initially true ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚ùå
```http
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(true)

```
#### ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖInstead do this ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ
```
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false)

```

```jsx harmony
import { useState } from 'react'
import {Player} from 'react-media-playback'

function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setisPlaying] = useState(false)
  let musicArray = [
    {title:'Song 1',subtitle:'Song sub',audio:'song1.mp3',image:'image1.jpg'},
    {title:'Song 2',subtitle:'Song sub',audio:'song2.mp3',image:'image2.jpg'},
  ]
  return (
    <>
    <Player audio={musicArray} isPlaying={isPlaying} setisPlaying={setisPlaying} />
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```
